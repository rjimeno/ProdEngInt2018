"""
Find out the maximum sub-array of non negative numbers from an array.
The sub-array should be continuous. That is, a sub-array created by choosing
the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid.

Maximum sub-array is defined in terms of the sum of the elements in the
sub-array. Sub-array A is greater than sub-array B if sum(A) > sum(B).

Example:

A : [1, 2, 5, -7, 2, 3]
The two sub-arrays are [1, 2, 5] [2, 3].
The answer is [1, 2, 5] as its sum is larger than [2, 3]

NOTE: If there is a tie, then compare with segment's length and return segment which has maximum length
NOTE 2: If there is still a tie, then return the segment with minimum starting index
